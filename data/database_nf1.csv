"Breast manifestations of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), or von Recklinghausen disease, it is characterized by multiple subcutaneous neurofibromas affecting the breast. Mammographically they appear as well-defined benign-appearing masses, often multiple. They are classically peri-areolar in location. Portions of the outline may be rimmed by air density reflecting their superficial nature (giving a halo). These multiple skin lesions can mimic and partially obscure breast lesions on mammogram. Sonographically neurofibromas are usually seen as well-defined hypoechoic masses with posterior acoustic enhancement located in the subcutaneous tissue with features somewhat similar to a fibroadenoma.",https://radiopaedia.org/articles/neurofibromatosis-type-1-breast-manifestations-1?lang=us
"Central nervous system manifestations of Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), or von Recklinghausen disease, are relatively common among these patients and has a variety of expressions. NF1 is a complex multi-systemic disease with a broad range of expression and unpredictable behavior.

Cognitive disability is the commonest neurological symptom described in children with this disease, and it does not improve in adulthood 1. A broad spectrum of neurological symptoms may be related to cerebrovascular conditions, malformations, and CNS tumors related to NF1.

The gliomas occur in all parts of the brain, with a predilection for the optic pathways, brainstem, and cerebellum. Many tumors are asymptomatic, but visual disturbances,  precocious puberty, acute hemiplegia or focal neurological deficits may manifest.

Multiple sclerosis and epilepsy have also been described in association with NF1. 

In result of the inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene, NF1 is also associated with increased incidence of numerous tumors, particularly for the CNS:
malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST)
previously known as neurofibrosarcoma
the overall risk of developing MPNST is ~10%
glioma
juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma
optic nerve glioma: most common in children younger than age six years.
diffuse brainstem glioma
spinal astrocytoma and spinal pilocytic astrocytoma
ganglioglioma

FASI: focal areas of signal intensity in deep white matter and basal ganglia or corpus callosum 5, i.e. areas of T2/FLAIR hyperintensity with no contrast enhancement
optic nerve glioma or optic pathway glioma (may manifest as enlarged optic foramen)
progressive sphenoid wing dysplasia
lambdoid suture defects
dural calcification at the vertex
dural ectasia

buphthalmos",https://radiopaedia.org/articles/neurofibromatosis-type-1-cns-manifestations-1?lang=us
"Cutaneous manifestations of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), or von Recklinghausen disease, are the heralding features of this multisystem neurocutaneous disorder, which is the most common phakomatosis.

Nowadays genetic testing permits the laboratory diagnosis of NF1 in as many as 95%, although in the majority of patients the diagnosis remains based on clinical manifestations 2.

As is the case with many phakomatoses, NF1 results in a variety of abnormalities of variable severity. To make the clinical diagnosis two or more of following are required:

>6 cafe au lait spots evident during one year
two or more neurofibromas or one plexiform neurofibroma
optic nerve glioma
distinctive osseous lesion (such as sphenoid wing dysplasia or thinning of long bone cortex with or without pseudoarthrosis)
two or more iris hamartomas (Lisch nodules)

"Musculoskeletal manifestations of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), or von Recklinghausen disease, are relatively common among these patients with skeletal abnormalities occurring in up to 50% of them
Mass effect and pressure-induced changes caused by skin and soft tissue enlargement associated with plexiform neurofibromas may cause deformities on the underlying bone.
Spinal deformities are common in patients with NF1, occurring in up to 50%. Scoliosis can occur in 21% of NF1 patients 1.
Bowing and pseudoarthrosis are related to mesodermal dysplasia and can occur in a variety of bones, but commonly affects the tibia. 
In result of the inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene, NF1 is also associated with increased incidence of numerous tumors, such as rhabdomyosarcoma.
The imaging spectrum includes

kyphoscoliosis
vertebral scalloping: can be associated with dural ectasia or neurofibromas
Intrathoracic meningocele
dural ectasia
hypoplastic posterior elements: thinning of the pedicles, transverse processes, and lamina
transverse process spindling
enlarged neural foramina
ribbon rib deformity, rib notching, and dysplasia
extrinsic pressure may result in deficient bone formation that could be expressed as cortical thinning, erosive defects, sclerosis, and periosteal proliferation
tibial pseudoarthrosis or, less commonly, ulnar pseudoarthrosis
bony dysplasias: especially affecting tibia
severe bowing: both lateral and anterior
multiple non-ossifying fibromas: metaphysis of long bones well-defined, expansile lucent lesions with sclerotic margins

"Orbital manifestations of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) reflects a mix of CNS, musculoskeletal and ocular disease. Usually, only one orbit is affected, commonly associated with an ipsilateral extracranial disease.

NF1 manifests in the orbit in the following ways:

plexiform neurofibromas of the intra-orbital cranial nerves, optic nerve sheath and/or sclera
Lisch nodules: iris hamartomas
sphenoid wing dysplasia

"Thoracic manifestations of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), or von Recklinghausen disease, are related to pulmonary and mediastinal features of this multisystem neurocutaneous disorder, which is the most common phakomatosis.

For thoracic manifestations involving the skeleton, such as focal thoracic scoliosis, enlarged neural foramina, posterior vertebral scalloping, and characteristic rib abnormalities, please refer to the article musculoskeletal manifestations of NF1.

It is estimated that ~5% of NF1 patients develop mediastinal tumors.
NF1 is a complex multi-systemic disease with a wide range of expression and unpredictable behavior. Thoracic manifestations are usually related to neurofibromas involving the mediastinum and chest wall, lateral thoracic meningoceles and pulmonary arterial hypertension.

Lung parenchymal disease is described, but it must be differentiated from other common etiologies that could be associated.

"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), also known as von Recklinghausen disease, is a multisystem neurocutaneous disorder, the most common phakomatosis, and a RASopathy. Additionally, it is also one of the most common inherited CNS disorders, autosomal dominant disorders, and inherited tumor syndromes. 
Neurofibromatosis affects 1:2500-3000 individuals. In half of the cases, the disease is inherited as an autosomal dominant condition. In the other half, the disease is due to a de novo mutation. There is a variable expression but 100% penetrance by 5 years of age.
As is the case with many phakomatoses, NF1 results in a variety of abnormalities of variable severity. To make the clinical diagnosis two or more of the following are required:

>6 cafe au lait spots evident during one year (prepubertal >0.5 cm, postpubertal >1.5 cm in size)
two or more neurofibromas or one plexiform neurofibroma
optic nerve glioma
distinctive osseous lesion (such as sphenoid wing dysplasia or thinning of long bone cortex with or without pseudoarthrosis)
two or more iris hamartomas (Lisch nodules)   
axillary or inguinal freckling
a primary relative with NF1 with above criteria
A mnemonic to help remember these features is CAFE SPOT.

In addition, ~45% (range 30-60%) of patients have learning disabilities, and approximately 1% have hypertension due to renal artery stenosis.

It is important to consider that NF1 has a much earlier age of onset than schwannomatosis and NF2, with approximately 50% of patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for NF1 by the age of 1 year and approximately 97% meeting the criteria by the age of 8 years. It should come as no surprise that a disease due to inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene (see below) is also associated with an increased incidence of numerous tumors:
pheochromocytoma
malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST)  ( ~10% of patients) 
Wilms tumor
rhabdomyosarcoma
renal angiomyolipoma
glioma
juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma (~20% of patients)
optic nerve glioma
diffuse brainstem glioma
spinal astrocytoma and spinal pilocytic astrocytoma
carcinoid tumor(s)
leiomyoma(s)
leiomyosarcoma
ganglioglioma
leukemia
The NF1 gene locus is on chromosome 17q11.2 and the gene product is neurofibromin, which acts as a tumor suppressor of the Ras/MAPK pathway; inactivation of the gene thus predisposes to tumor development For this reason, the disorder is classified as a RASopathy. 
The disease primarily is a hamartomatous disorder that involves the ectoderm and mesoderm. Usually, three types of neurofibromas occur in this disorder and are distinguished on the basis of their gross and microscopic appearances. 
localized neurofibroma (cutaneous neurofibroma): the most common type, is a focal lesion that typically is located in the dermis and subcutis
diffuse neurofibroma (subcutaneous neurofibroma): localized in the subcutis, usually in the head and neck region. 
plexiform neurofibroma: considered pathognomonic if present; they may be seen in virtually any location but usually occur in the neck, pelvis, and extremities ",https://radiopaedia.org/articles/neurofibromatosis-type-1
"Neurofibromatosis is a genetic disorder of the nervous system. Tumors form on your nerve tissues. Mainly, neurofibromatosis disorders affect the growth and development of nerve cell tissue. The disorders are known as neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). NF1 is the more common type of neurofibromatosis. Schwannomatosis has recently been identified as a third and more rare type of neurofibromatosis, but doctors don’t know much about it yet.

You may also hear NF1 called Recklinghausen disease, von Recklinghausen disease, von Recklinghausen’s phakomatosis, von Recklinghausen’s neurofibromatosis, neurofibroma (multiple), neurofibromatosis-pheochromocytoma-duodenal carcinoid syndrome, or peripheral neurofibromatosis. It causes multiple café au lait spots (patches of tan or light brown skin) and neurofibromas (soft, fleshy growths) on or under your skin. It can also cause enlarged or deformed bones and curvature of the spine (scoliosis). Occasionally, tumors may develop in the brain, on cranial nerves, or on the spinal cord. About 50% to 75% of people with NF1 also have learning disabilities.

NF2 is also called bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis, vestibular schwannoma neurofibromatosis, or central neurofibromatosis. It’s much less common than NF1 and is characterized by multiple tumors on the cranial and spinal nerves. Tumors that affect both of the auditory nerves and hearing loss beginning in the teens or early 20s are generally the first symptoms of NF2.

Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) symptoms

The following symptoms appear in people with NF1:

Several (usually 6 or more) café au lait spots
Multiple freckles in the armpit or groin area
Tiny growths in the iris (colored area) of the eye; these are called Lisch nodules and usually do not affect eyesight.
Neurofibromas that occur on or under the skin, sometimes even deep within the body. These are benign (harmless) tumors. But in rare cases, they can turn malignant or cancerous.
Bone deformities, including a twisted spine (scoliosis) or bowed legs
Tumors along the optic nerve, which may cause eyesight problems
Nerve-related pain
High blood pressure
Osteoporosis
Learning disabilities
Large head size
Short stature
Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) symptoms

People with NF2 often display the following symptoms:

Loss of hearing
Weakness of the muscles of the face
Dizziness
Poor balance
Uncoordinated walking
Cataracts (cloudy areas on the lens of the eye) that develop at an unusually early age
Headaches
Schwannomatosis symptoms

People with schwannomatosis may have the following symptoms:

Pain from the enlarging tumors
Numbness and tingling of the fingers or toes
Weakness in the fingers and toes
Chronic pain
Loss of muscle
Neurofibromatosis Causes
Neurofibromatosis is often inherited (passed on by family members through your genes). But about 50% of people newly diagnosed with the disorder have no family history of the condition. That’s because it can result from a sudden mutation (change) in your genes. Once this change takes place, you can pass the mutant gene on to future generations. Mutations that lead to neurofibromatosis include:

Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1): The NF1 gene on chromosome 17 makes a protein called neurofibromin that controls your cells’ growth. The mutation of this gene causes a neurofibromin loss and uncontrolled cell growth.
Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2): The NF2 gene on chromosome 22 makes a protein called merlin or schwannomin. It suppresses tumors. Changes to this gene cause a loss of merlin and uncontrolled cell growth.
Schwannomatosis: Mutations of the two known genes linked to schwannomatosis, SMARCB1 and LZTR1, which both suppress tumors, are associated with this type of neurofibromatosis.

Neurofibromatosis is diagnosed using a number of tests, including:

Physical examination
Medical history
Family history
X-rays
Computerized tomography (CT) scans
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
Biopsy of neurofibromas
Eye tests
Tests for particular symptoms, such as hearing or balance tests
Genetic testing
To receive a diagnosis of NF1, you must have two of the following features:

Six or more café au lait spots that are 1.5 centimeters or larger in people who have had puberty, or 0.5 centimeters or larger in people who haven’t
Two or more neurofibromas (tumors that develop from the cells and tissues that cover nerves) of any type, or one or more plexiform neurofibroma (a nerve that has become thick and misshapen due to the abnormal growth of cells and tissues that cover the nerve)
Freckling in the armpit or groin
Optic glioma (tumor of the optic pathway)
Two or more Lisch nodules
A distinctive bony lesion, dysplasia of the sphenoid bone, or dysplasia or thinning of long bone cortex
A first-degree relative with NF1
To be diagnosed with NF2, you must have:

Bilateral (on both sides) vestibular schwannomas, also known as acoustic neuromas. These are benign tumors that develop from the balance and hearing nerves supplying the inner ear.
or

Family history of NF2 (first-degree family relative) plus unilateral (on one side) or bilateral vestibular schwannomas, or any two of the following health conditions:
Multiple meningiomas (tumors that occur in the meninges, the membranes that cover and protect the brain and spinal cord)
Glioma (cancer of the brain that begins in glial cells, which are those that surround and support nerve cells)
Any neurofibromas
Schwannoma
Juvenile cataracts
Gradual hearing loss
Ringing in the ears
Balance problems
Headaches
Schwannomatosis diagnosis is based on these criteria:

If you’re 30 or older, you have no evidence of vestibular tumors on an MRI scan, no known NF2 gene mutation, and two or more schwannomas within or between skin layers, one being confirmed by a biopsy.
You have one schwannoma confirmed by biopsy and a first-degree relative who also meets the criteria.
If you have a type called segmental schwannomatosis, you have tumors limited to one area of the body, such as your arm, leg, or spine.

There’s no cure for neurofibromatosis. Treatments focus on controlling symptoms. There’s no standard treatment for NF, and many symptoms, such as café au lait spots, do not need treatment. When treatment is necessary, options may include:

Surgery to remove problem growths or tumors
Treatment that includes chemotherapy or radiation if a tumor has turned malignant, or cancerous
Surgery for bone problems, like scoliosis
Therapy (including physical therapy, counseling, or support groups)
Cataract removal surgery
Aggressive treatment of pain linked to the condition
Stereotactic radiosurgery
Auditory brainstem and cochlear implants

Neurofibromatosis complications may vary from person to person. They typically stem from a growing tumor pressing against your nerve tissue or an internal organ.

Possible NF1 complications include:

Neurological problems like trouble learning or thinking
Anxiety or distress with changes to your appearance, like large numbers of cafe au lait spots
Skeletal problems, like bowing of the legs, scoliosis, fractures that don’t heal, or low bone density that increases your risk of osteoporosis
Vision problems due to a tumor pressing against the optic nerve
Problems during times of hormonal changes, such as puberty or pregnancy
Cardiovascular problems like high blood pressure
Breathing problems
Higher risk of some cancers, such as breast cancer, leukemia, colorectal cancer, brain tumors, and some soft tissue cancers
Benign adrenal gland tumor that could cause high blood pressure
Possible NF2 complications include:

Partial hearing loss or deafness
Nerve damage in the face
Benign skin tumors or schwannomas
Vision problems
Weakness or numbness in your extremities
Benign brain or spine tumors that need to be removed with surgery
One possible schwannomatosis complication is severe pain that requires specialist medical treatment or even surgery.

Your outlook depends on the type of NF you have. Often, the symptoms of NF1 are mild, and people who have it are able to lead full and productive lives. Sometimes, pain and deformity can lead to significant disability. The NF2 outlook depends on your age at the start of the disease and on the number and location of tumors. Some can be life-threatening.",https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/neurofibromatosis
"There are several types of neurofibromatosis.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1, or von Recklinghausen disease) is most prevalent, occurring in 1 of 2500 to 3000 people. It causes neurologic, cutaneous, and sometimes soft-tissue or bone manifestations. The gene for NF1 is located on band 17q11.2 and encodes synthesis of neurofibromin; > 1000 mutations have been identified. Although it is an autosomal dominant disorder , 20 to 50% of cases are caused by a de novo germ cell mutation.

Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) accounts for 10% of cases, occurring in about 1 of 35,000 people. It manifests primarily as congenital bilateral acoustic neuromas (vestibular schwannomas). The gene for NF2 is located on band 22q11 and encodes synthesis of merlin, a tumor suppressor; 200 mutations have been identified. Most people with NF2 inherited it from one of their parents.

Schwannomatosis, a rare disorder, is classified as a 3rd type of neurofibromatosis. In 15% of cases, this type is familial and related to a germline mutation in the SMARCB1 gene, a tumor suppressor gene located at 22q11.23, very close to the NF2 gene. In the remaining cases, the genetic basis is not well-understood, but in tissue from some patients, other mutations in the same gene are involved. Two or more schwannomas develop in spinal and peripheral nerves and are sometimes quite painful; however, acoustic neuromas do not develop. Schwannomatosis used to be considered a form of NF2 because multiple schwannomas are present in both conditions; however, the clinical picture is different, and the genes involved are distinct.

Peripheral and central neurofibromas
Tumors may be peripheral or central.

Peripheral tumors are common in NF1 and can develop anywhere along the course of peripheral nerves. The tumors are neurofibromas, which develop from nerve sheaths and consist of mixtures of Schwann cells, fibroblasts, neural cells, and mast cells. Most appear during adolescence. Occasionally, they transform to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. There are multiple forms:

Cutaneous neurofibromas are soft and fleshy.
Subcutaneous neurofibromas are firm and nodular.
Nodular plexiform neurofibromas may involve spinal nerve roots, typically growing through an intervertebral foramen to cause intraspinal and extraspinal masses (dumbbell tumor). The intraspinal part may compress the spinal cord.
Diffuse plexiform neurofibromas (subcutaneous nodules or amorphous overgrowth of underlying bone or Schwann cells) can be disfiguring and may cause deficits distal to the neurofibroma. Plexiform neurofibromas can become malignant and they appear to be the most common precursors to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors in people with NF1.
Schwannomas are derived from Schwann cells, rarely undergo malignant transformation, and can occur in peripheral nerves anywhere in the body.
Central tumors have several forms:

Optic gliomas: These tumors are low-grade pilocytic astrocytomas, which may be asymptomatic or may progress enough to compress the optic nerve and cause blindness. They occur in younger children; these tumors can usually be identified by age 5 and rarely develop after age 10. They occur in NF1.
Acoustic neuromas (vestibular schwannomas): These tumors may cause dizziness, ataxia, deafness, and tinnitus due to compression of the 8th cranial nerve; they sometimes cause facial weakness due to compression of the adjacent 7th nerve. They are the distinguishing feature of NF2.
Meningiomas : These tumors develop in some people, particularly those with NF2.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)
Most patients with NF1 are asymptomatic. Some present with neurologic symptoms or bone deformities. In > 90%, characteristic skin lesions are apparent at birth or develop during infancy.

Café-au-lait lesions are medium-brown (café-au-lait), freckle-like macules, distributed most commonly over the trunk, pelvis, and flexor creases of elbows and knees. Although children who do not have neurofibromatosis may have 2 or 3 café-au-lait lesions, children who have NF1 have ≥ 6 such macules and often many more. These macules are > 5 mm in affected prepubertal children and > 15 mm in postpubertal patients (see table Diagnosing Neurofibromatosis ).

Cutaneous neurofibromas, which arise along small peripheral nerves, are common. During late childhood, these flesh-colored cutaneous tumors of various sizes and shapes appear, ranging in number from several to thousands. They are usually asymptomatic.

Plexiform neurofibromas can develop and have a tendency to grow to large sizes, causing irregularly thickened, distorted structures, sometimes with grotesque deformities that can impinge on nerves and other structures. Plexiform neurofibromas can also involve cranial nerves, typically the 5th, 9th, and 10th.

Neurologic symptoms vary, depending on location and number of neurofibromas. Larger neurofibromas may press on their nerve of origin and cause distal paresthesia, pain, and sensory loss or weakness, depending on the function of the nerve that is involved. Neurofibromas that form along spinal nerve roots, especially where the nerve roots are contained by bone, can compress the nerve roots and cause radicular pain, weakness, or widespread sensory loss in that nerve distribution. Plexiform neurofibromas that compress cranial nerves cause deficits typical of those nerves.

An optic glioma and Lisch nodules (iris hamartomas) occur in some patients. Optic gliomas are typically asymptomatic and do not require treatment unless they progressively increase in size.

Patients with NF1 can also have changes in their arterial walls that may lead to Moyamoya syndrome (stenosis or occlusion of arteries in and around the circle of Willis with formation of small collateral arteries), or intracranial artery aneurysms. Some children have learning problems and slightly larger heads.

Bone abnormalities include

Fibrous dysplasia
Subperiosteal bone cysts
Vertebral scalloping
Scoliosis
Thinning of the long-bone cortex
Pseudarthrosis
Absence of the greater wing of the sphenoid bone (posterior orbital wall), with consequent pulsating exophthalmos


Children and adolescents with NF1 may have childhood chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia) and rhabdomyosarcoma . Pheochromocytomas may occur at any age.

Malignant tumors are much less common but still more common than in the general population; they include supratentorial or brain stem gliomas and transformation of plexiform neurofibromas to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. These tumors may develop at any age.
In NF2, bilateral acoustic neuromas develop and become symptomatic during childhood or early adulthood. They cause hearing loss, unsteadiness, and sometimes headache or facial weakness. Bilateral 8th cranial (vestibulocochlear) nerve masses may be present. Family members may have gliomas, meningiomas , or schwannomas.
In schwannomatosis, multiple schwannomas develop on cranial, spinal, and peripheral nerves. Acoustic neuromas do not develop, and patients do not become deaf. Also, the other types of tumors that sometimes occur in neurocutaneous disorders do not develop.

The first symptom of schwannomatosis is usually pain, which may become chronic and severe. Other symptoms may develop, depending on the location of the schwannomas.
Clinical evaluation
Brain MRI or head CT
Most patients with NF1 are identified during routine examination, examination for cosmetic complaints, or evaluation of a positive family history. (See also guidelines for the diagnosis and management of individuals with NF1 from the United Kingdom Neurofibromatosis Association Clinical Advisory Board, guidelines for the health supervision of children with NF1 from a collaboration of experts, clinical practice guidelines for the care of adults with NF1 from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics.)

Diagnosis of all 3 types is clinical (see Table: Diagnosing Neurofibromatosis ) by detailed physical examination focused on the cutaneous, skeletal, and neurologic systems. NF1 should be suspected and monitored for in children who have multiple café-au-lait spots even if they do not have other features or family history of NF1.

Brain MRI is done in patients with neurologic symptoms or signs and, when detailed visual testing is not possible, in younger children who meet the clinical criteria for NF1 and who may have an optic glioma. T2-weighted MRI may show thickening or tortuosity of the optic nerves and parenchymal hyperintense lesions that change over time and correlate with small cystic structures in NF1; MRI may help identify acoustic neuromas or meningiomas in NF2. If acoustic neuroma is suspected, CT of the petrous ridge can be done; it typically shows widening of the auditory canal.

Genetic testing is not typically done in these disorders because not all mutations are known and the clinical criteria are clear.

For symptomatic neurofibromas, possibly surgery or removal by laser or electrocautery
For malignant tumors, chemotherapy
No general treatment for neurofibromatosis is available.

Neurofibromas that cause severe symptoms may require surgical removal or, if small, removal by laser or electrocautery. Surgical removal of plexiform neurofibromas may obliterate function of the involved nerve, and the neurofibromas have a tendency to recur at the site of removal. There are ongoing clinical trials on several medical treatments of plexiform and spinal neurofibromas, including the use of sirolimus.

Most optic gliomas are asymptomatic and just need to be monitored for progression. For both progressive optic gliomas and central nervous system lesions that have become malignant, chemotherapy is the treatment of choice.

Genetic counseling is advisable. If either parent has neurofibromatosis, risk to subsequent offspring is 50%; if neither has it, risk for subsequent children is unclear because new mutations are common, particularly in NF1.

Once the diagnosis is considered, referral should be made to any clinician skilled in the diagnosis of NF1, including geneticists, paediatricians, neurologists or dermatologists. Routine screening investigations are not recommended for the detection of the majority of complications associated with the condition. However, visual assessment should be performed in young children because they do not complain of visual impairment (see section on optic pathway glioma). Furthermore, given the high frequency of learning and behavioural problems in NF1 children, monitoring is essential (see section on cognitive impairment). Baseline brain and spine MRI, and routine imaging of the chest and abdomen to identify asymptomatic tumours, do not influence management and should not be undertaken.

The mainstay of management is age specific monitoring of disease manifestations and patient education. At all ages it is most likely that severe disease complications such as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNST) will become symptomatic between appointments. NF1 individuals need to be encouraged to seek review of any unusual symptoms and ask if they are related to NF1. All children with uncomplicated disease need to be assessed once a year (table 3​3),), ideally by one paediatrician in each area to facilitate coordinated care. Older adults should be offered the opportunity of attending the clinic on an annual basis. Young adults aged 16–25 years are at a vulnerable stage of life and require education about NF1 and its possible complications. Counselling about disease inheritance and psychological support are advised, particularly as neurofibromas often start to develop in late adolescence.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2598063/
"
Neurofibromatosis (NF) is a genetic neurological disorder that can affect the brain, spinal cord, nerves and skin. Tumors, or neurofibromas, grow along the body's nerves or on or underneath the skin. Scientists have classified NF into two distinct types: neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and NF2. NF1, formerly known as von Recklinghausen's NF, is the more common of the types. It occurs in approximately 1 in 4,000 births. NF2, also referred to as bilateral acoustic NF, central NF or vestibular NF, occurs less frequently- 1 in 40,000 births. Occurrences of NF1 and NF2 are present among all racial groups and affect both sexes equally. The tumors arise from changes in the nerve cells and skin cells. Tumors also may press on the body's vital areas as their size increases. NF may lead to developmental abnormalities and/or increased chances of having learning disabilities. Other forms of NF, where the symptoms are not consistent with that of NF1 or NF2, have been observed. A rare form of NF is schwannomatosis. However, the genetic cause of this form of NF has not been found.
Symptoms for neurofibromatosis type 1 include:

Presence of light brown sports (café-au-lait) on the skin.

Appearance of two or more neurofibromas (pea-sized bumps) that can grow either on the nerve tissue, under the skin or on many nerve tissues.

Manifestation of freckles under the armpits or in the groin areas.

Appearance of tiny tan clumps of pigment in the iris of the eyes (Lisch nodules).

Tumors along the optic nerve of the eye (optic glioma).

Severe curvature of the spine (scoliosis).

Enlargement or malformation of other bones in the skeletal system.

Symptoms for NF1 vary for each individual. Those that are skin-related are often present at birth, during infancy and by a child's tenth birthday. From ages 10 to 15, neurofibromas may become apparent. Symptoms such as café-au-lait spots, freckling and Lisch nodules pose minimal or no health risk to a person. Though neurofibromas are generally a cosmetic concern for those with NF1, they can sometimes be psychologically distressing. For 15 percent of individuals with NF1, the symptoms can be severely debilitating. Neurofibromas can grow inside the body and may affect organ systems. Hormonal changes at puberty and/or even pregnancy may increase the size of neurofibromas. Nearly 50 percent of children with NF1 have speech problems, learning disabilities, seizures and hyperactivity. Less than one percent of those affected with NF1 may have malignant tumors and may require treatment.

Symptoms for neurofibromatosis type 2 include:

Tumors along the eighth cranial nerve (schwannomas).

Meningiomas and other brain tumors.

Ringing noises inside the ear (tinnitus), hearing loss and/or deafness.

Cataracts at a young age.

Spinal tumors.

Balance problems.

Wasting of muscles (atrophy).

The rare form of NF, schwannomatosis, which was recently identified, does not develop on the eighth cranial nerves, and does not cause hearing loss. It causes pain primarily, and in any part of the body. Though schwannomatosis may also lead to numbness, weakness or balance problems like NF1 or NF2, the symptoms are less severe.
Neurofibromatosis is diagnosed from a combination of findings. For children to be diagnosed with NF1, they must show at least two of the aforementioned symptoms associated with NF1. A physical examination by a doctor familiar with the disorder is usually performed. Doctors may use special lamps to examine the skin for café-au-lait spots. Doctors may also rely on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), X-rays, computerized tomography (CT scan) and blood tests to detect defects in the NF1 gene.


Genetic testing is also used to diagnose NF1 and NF2. Testing conducted before birth (prenatal) is helpful to identify individuals who have a family history of the disorder, but do not yet have the symptoms. Still, gene tests have no way of predicting the severity of NF1 or NF2. Genetic testing is performed by either direct gene mutation analysis and/or linkage analysis. Mutation analysis looks to identify the particular gene changes that cause NF. A linkage analysis is useful if the mutation analysis does not provide enough conclusive information. With at linkage analysis, blood tests from multiple family members are taken to track the chromosome that carry the disease-causing gene through two or more generations. Linkage testing is around 90 percent accurate in determining whether individuals have NF. Mutation analysis is 95 percent accurate in finding a mutation for NF1, and 65 percent accurate for NF2.
Though there is no cure for either NF1 or NF2, there are ways to treat the effects the disease. Surgery may be helpful in removing tumors, though there is a risk of the tumors regenerating. For optic gliomas, treatment may include surgery and/or radiation. For scoliosis, treatment may include surgery or back braces. For symptoms associated with NF2, surgery may be a viable option, however not without complications that could result in additional loss of hearing or deafness. Hearing aids are ineffective when parts of the auditory nerve are removed. A breakthrough in treatment became available recently to NF2 patients, when the Food and Drug Administration approved an Auditory Brainstem Implant [fda.gov] for those who have parts of their auditory nerve removed and have suffered from subsequent hearing loss. The implant transmits sound signals to the brain directly and allows people to hear certain sounds and speech . 
Neurofibromatosis can either be an inherited disorder or the product of a gene mutation. Both NF1 and NF2 are caused by two separate abnormal genes and may be inherited from parents who have NF or may be the result of a mutation in the sperm or egg cells. NF is considered an autosomal dominant disorder because the gene is located on one of the 22 chromosome pairs, called autosomes.The gene for NF1 is located on chromosome 17. Children have a 50 percent chance of inheriting the genes that cause NF if the parent has NF. The type of NF the child inherits will be the same as that of the parent. Therefore, if the parent has NF1, there will be a 50 percent chance the child will have NF1. If the parent has NF2, there will be a 50 percent chance the child will have NF2. The only difference between the child and the parent in these circumstances is the severity of NF and the appearance of symptoms. The presence of only one changed or affected gene can cause the disorder to appear. However, the action of the unaffected gene that is paired with the dominant gene does not prvent the disorder from appearing. People with NF can make two different kinds of reproductive cells: one that can cause a child to have NF and the other that will produce an unaffected child, if that is the gene that happens to be used. When an unaffected individual conceives a child with a person with NF, there are four possible cell combinations - two combinations that will yield a child with NF and the other two that will yield an unaffected child.

"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a hereditary condition commonly associated with multiple café-au-lait spots on the skin. Café-au-lait spots are light brown in color, like the color of “coffee with milk.” About 10% to 25% of the general population has café-au-lait spots; NF1 is suspected when a person has 6 or more. People with NF1 also tend to develop varying numbers of neurofibromas, meaning benign (noncancerous) tumors on the covering of the nerves. Neurofibromas are often seen as raised bumps on the skin and can occur anywhere on the body. While these skin changes do not have serious medical consequences, they can affect a person’s appearance. Plexiform neurofibromas, which form under the skin or deeper in the body, are also benign tumors. However, these can grow quite large and can cause significant medical problems, affecting the structure of nearby bone, skin, and muscle.

Other benign and cancerous tumors that can occur in people with NF1 include:

Benign eye tumors, called Lisch nodules, that grow on the iris of the eye and cancerous eye tumors, called glioma, that grow in the optic nerve

Brain tumors

Adrenal gland tumors

Muscle tumors

Spinal cord tumors

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST), a type of cancer called sarcoma that grows from the cells around nerve endings

Some other features of NF1 include:

High blood pressure

Learning disabilities, which can occur in about 50% of people with NF1

Childhood leukemia

Bone changes

Scoliosis, meaning curving of the spine

Short stature (height)

Multiple features have been associated with NF1, but the overall cancer risk is low, less than 7% over a person’s lifetime. The number of features present and how severe the symptoms are can vary among people with NF1, even within the same family. Sometimes NF1 is “segmental,” meaning that it affects only 1 portion of the body, such as 1 leg or 1 arm.
NF1 is a genetic condition. This means that the cancer risk and other features of NF1 can be passed from generation to generation in a family. The gene commonly associated with NF1 is also called NF1. The gene is noted in italics to help distinguish the gene from the condition. A mutation (alteration) in the NF1 gene gives a person an increased risk of developing the various symptoms of NF1, including cancerous and benign tumors. Most people with NF1 have a mutation in the NF1 gene. It is now believed that mutations in other genes may also produce multiple nerve tumors. In particular, a different tumor suppressor gene called INI 1 may cause multiple schwannomas, a type of tumor of the nervous system, on nerves in some people. This is a different disease from NF1 since the main identifying feature of NF1 is neurofibroma rather than schwannomas. Both are tumors that grow on nerves, but they have different causes. Research is ongoing to learn more about NF1 and other diseases causing nerve tumors.
Normally, every cell has 2 copies of each gene: 1 inherited from the mother and 1 inherited from the father. NF1 follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, in which a mutation happens in only 1 copy of the gene. If a copy of the gene with the mutation is inherited, that gene becomes the dominant gene and can cause features of NF1. A parent with NF1 may pass along a copy of their normal gene or a copy of the gene with the mutation. Therefore, a child who has a parent with a genetic mutation has a 50% chance of inheriting that mutation. A brother, sister, or parent of a person who has a mutation also has a 50% chance of having the same mutation. However, if the parents test negative for the mutation, the risk to the siblings significantly decreases but their risk may still be higher than an average risk.

Options exist for people interested in having a child when a prospective parent carries a gene mutation that increases the risk for this hereditary cancer syndrome. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is a medical procedure done in conjunction with in-vitro fertilization (IVF). It allows people who carry a specific known genetic mutation to reduce the likelihood that their children will inherit the condition. A woman’s eggs are removed and fertilized in a laboratory. When the embryos reach a certain size, 1 cell is removed and is tested for the hereditary condition in question. The parents can then choose to transfer embryos which do not have the mutation. PGD has been in use for over 2 decades and has been used for several hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes. However, this is a complex procedure with financial, physical, and emotional factors to consider before starting. For more information, talk with an assisted reproduction specialist at a fertility clinic.
NF1 is among the most common genetic conditions. It is estimated that as many as 1 in 3,000 people has NF1. About 50% of people with NF1 do not have any family history of the condition. They have a de novo (new) mutation in the NF1 gene. However, the children of anyone with NF1 have a higher risk of inheriting the condition.

NF1 is diagnosed when a person meets the official diagnostic criteria for NF1 that was developed at a National Institutes of Health Consensus Conference in 1987. Based on these criteria, a person who has at least 2 of the following features is considered to have NF1:

6 or more café-au-lait spots. These spots must be more than 5 millimeters (mm) in diameter in young children and more than 15 mm in diameter after puberty.

2 or more neurofibromas or 1 plexiform neurofibroma

Freckling around the armpits or groin

Optic glioma, which is a tumor on the optic nerve in the brain that effects vision

2 or more Lisch nodules, which are tumors on the iris of the eye

Specific bone changes, including sphenoid dysplasia, which is an abnormality of 1 of the bones forming the skull, or thinning of the long bones

A parent, sibling (brother or sister), or child with NF1

If a person has a family history of NF1, they are suspected of having NF1 if they have any features of the condition. Genetic testing for mutations in the NF1 gene is available for people diagnosed with NF1.


The lifetime risk of cancer developing in a person with NF1 is estimated to be about 7%. This generally happens when a benign (non-cancerous) neurofibroma turns into a cancerous form called sarcoma, which grows much faster, invades nearby structures, and sometimes metastasizes (spreads) to other areas of the body.


Suggested screenings for people with NF1 or at risk for NF1 include:

Yearly examination by a doctor who is experienced with NF1

Yearly eye examinations, beginning in childhood. This may become less frequent in adulthood.

Yearly blood pressure monitoring

Developmental assessments in childhood, as needed

Other evaluations, such as imaging scans, like CT scan or MRI, as needed for symptoms

Screening recommendations may change over time as new technologies are developed and more is learned about NF1. It is important to talk with your doctor about appropriate screening tests. In some areas, comprehensive NF1 clinics may be available to help with coordination of medical care.
The usual treatment approach for any tumors associated with NF1 is to watch the person closely for signs of tumor growth or whether he/she is having such symptoms as pain or weakness. This is called watchful waiting, watch and wait, or active surveillance. If symptoms develop over time, then surgery is done to remove the tumor(s). It is usually possible to remove a tumor growing on or from nerves, and to preserve the nerve involved, unless the tumor is plexiform. Such plexiform tumors are more spread out and often get into the nerve, which makes it harder to remove the tumor without hurting the nerve. A cancerous tumor may be treated with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of both. Clinical trials, meaning research studies, for neurofibromatosis are ongoing and currently focus on drugs that affect the ras signaling pathway inside the tumor cell. Ras communicates signals from outside the cell to the nucleus of the cell. Problems in the ras pathway are common in tumors in NF1.

"Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1), formerly known as von Recklinghausen NF or peripheral NF, is
the most common form of NF. Occurring in 1 out of every 3,000 births, it is characterized
by multiple café au lait (light brown) skin spots and neurofibromas (small benign
growths) on or under the skin. Some people with NF1 develop large, potentially disfiguring
neurofibromas. About 50% of people with NF also have learning challenges. Softening
and curving of bones and curvature of the spine (scoliosis) can occur in some patients
with NF1. Occasionally, tumors may develop in the brain, or arise from cranial or spinal
nerves. While NF tumors are benign (not cancerous), they may cause health problems by
pressing on nearby body tissues. In a minority of cases, a benign NF1 tumor may become
malignant (cancerous). But 85-90% of people with NF1 will never develop a malignant
tumor related to neurofibromatosis. NF1 is usually diagnosed in childhood. 
One of the first and most pressing concerns a person might have after a diagnosis of NF1
is how it affects life expectancy. You might see that some research shows affected people
have a shorter-than-average life expectancy. Although two-thirds of people with NF will
never develop any major medical symptoms, some people with NF1 may have shortened
life expectancies because of uncommon but serious NF1-related complications, mainly
malignancies (cancers) and problems with blood vessels. These situations may be rare, but
they are concerning, and screening for them is an important part of NF1 management.
NF1 symptoms are different for each individual. It is impossible to predict how mildly or
severely affected someone will be, or what medical issues they will develop. This can be
frustrating for patients and their families. That is why it is very important for patients with
NF1 to be treated by a group of healthcare providers knowledgeable about the disorder. 

No one person will have all the possible symptoms of NF1. Many people are quite mildly affected.
There is a range of severities, and we currently have no way to predict which symptoms will
appear in an individual. People with NF1 may experience the following:
Café Au Lait spots: These flat, light brown spots on the skin are not harmful.
Neurofibromas: These are the lumps or bumps on and under the skin that are typical of NF1. They
can be on the skin surface (cutaneous neurofibroma) or under the skin (subcutaneous neurofibroma).
Most are not a medical issue, but can cause pain and itching. The number of neurofibromas can
be different between each person. They can be mild and only a few in number, or more severe and
be in the thousands. Please be aware that photos on the internet of neurofibromas tend to show severe
cases. These images are not an accurate picture of what most patients with NF1 look like.
A less common type of neurofibroma is called a plexiform neurofibroma. They occur in 25%
of people with NF1. They can grow to be large and can cause a number of problems such as
pressure on nerves and organs. These types of neurofibromas can become malignant in a
minority of cases (about 10%).
Cognitive Differences: Intelligence in NF1 is usually in the normal range, but children may need
extra help in school. Learning challenges occur in about 50% of children with NF1.
Optic Pathway Tumors: An optic glioma is a tumor that develops in the cells surrounding the
optic nerve, the nerve behind the eye. About 15% of children with NF1 will develop an optic
glioma. Children are most at risk for optic gliomas when they are under the age of six years.
Most of the time, optic gliomas do not cause any symptoms and do not require treatment, but
sometimes can affect vision and may require chemotherapy.
Delayed or Early Puberty: Most people with NF1 will start puberty at the expected age range,
but some may have precocious (early) or delayed puberty.
Small Stature: Affects about 30% of people with NF1 and may be treated with growth hormone.
High Blood Pressure: For a small percentage of people, hypertension is one of the most serious
complications of NF1. People with NF1 should have their blood pressure checked at least annually.
Bone Issues: Tibial bowing (curved lower leg bone) is seen in about 5% of patients.
Scoliosis (curvature of the spine) occurs in 12-20% of patients

Because NF1 involves many different systems of the body, doctors and staff from many
different specialties may be involved in your care.
This is most conveniently done at a specialized NF clinic. You can find a list of NF
specialty clinics at ctf.org. Many of these NF clinics offer coordinated care so that
specialists are in communication with one another and may be able to see you on the
same day. If you do not have access to a specialty NF clinic, you may need to consult
these specialists one at a time. It is important to see specialists who know about NF. For
example, seek out an ophthalmologist (eye doctor) who knows what changes to look
for in NF1 patients and the right methods to check for them. Your doctor may refer you
to healthcare professionals who are experts in different NF1-related issues. You may be
referred to the following:
• Genetics: Medical geneticists are physicians with expertise in the diagnosis and
management of genetic disorders including NF. Genetic counselors are healthcare
professionals with training in medical genetics and personal counseling. Their job is
to explain the genetic contribution to a medical condition and the various choices that
can be made to deal with that condition.
• Dermatology: Dermatologists are trained to evaluate and treat conditions
of the skin, hair, and nails.
• Neurology: Neurological specialists are trained in the treatment and diagnosis
of conditions affecting the brain and nerves.
• Ophthalmology: These specialists are trained to diagnose, monitor, and treat
(through medicine or surgery) conditions affecting the eyes and vision-related
structures in the body.
• Orthopedics: This branch of medicine deals with conditions involving the
muscles and bones.
• Oncology: Oncologists specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of different types of
benign and malignant tumors.
• Psychology: Psychologists diagnose and treat emotional and behavioral issues.
• Cardiology: Cardiologists specialize in the heart and major blood vessels. They manage
cardiac conditions such as heart abnormalities.
• Pediatrics: Pediatricians are experts in the medical care of children and adolescents
The most common problems in children with NF1 are learning challenges and related
problems. These affect about 50% of children with NF1. Most children with NF1 have
normal intelligence; however, they may have issues in the processing of information.
Problems with working memory, attention, visual-motor function, and spatial orientation
are common issues. Keep in mind that these types of issues in NF1 are NOT universal.
Early intervention to address any learning issues can make a big difference. Working
with your child’s school and teachers to address these issues is vital.
What is known about cognitive and developmental issues in NF1:
1. For babies, delayed crawling, sitting, walking, and talking may be observed.
2. For school-age children, difficulties in handwriting, focus and attention, and verbal
memory may occur.
3. At all ages, patients with NF1 often have difficulties in organization and time
management.
4. Learning challenges in NF1 do not get worse over time, but it may appear that way,
as school tasks become more complex at each grade level.",https://www.ctf.org/images/uploads/documents/CTF-NF1_Brochure_5.17web.pdf
